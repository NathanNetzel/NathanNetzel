👋 **Welcome to my GitHub!**  
I’m an Electrical Engineering undergraduate at Londrina State University with a strong focus on embedded systems, electronic instrumentation, and hardware development.

Here you'll find a collection of my projects, including:  
- 📸 **Photos and schematics** of PCBs I’ve designed using *Altium Designer*, such as:  
  - Development of a **compact on-board computer** for sounding rockets.  
  - A **versatile low-cot data acquisition system** for testing small rocket engines using *STM32* ARM microcontrollers.  
  - Other **dedicated embedded hardware** based on ARM microcontrollers.

- ⚙️ **Sensor libraries** written in C using the *STM32 HAL* framework.  
- 🚀 Embedded algorithms for aerospace applications, such as apogee detection with Kalman filtering.

Other experiences include:  
- 🧠 Leading over 100 students as Project Director of the *IEEE Student Branch*, managing projects with the Scrum methodology.  
- 🔒 Developing a smart electronic lock system.  
- 📊 Applying statistical algorithms in R for engineering education through consultancy projects.  
- 👨‍🏫 Teaching electronics fundamentals to Child Prodigies.

💡 **My goal** is to bridge theory and hands-on engineering by building practical, innovative solutions and sharing knowledge with the open-source community.
